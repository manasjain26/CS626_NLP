The baseline code is this: BiLSTMBaseline.ipynb
It is recommended to run the baseline code from this site: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1lhBd-gxsXNVeQJtBXoLZ7HABI5yYttrw?usp=sharing
The CNN based code is available in two formats: CNNBiLSTMCRF.ipynb for jupyter notebooks and main.py can be run as python script

The following utilities are to be installed for the CNN based code:
pytorch, nltk, torchvision, numpy, seaborn, pandas, matplotlib, tqdm, scikit-learn, sklearn

Also download the glove embedding from the link and extract it in the source directory: http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/wordvecs/glove.6B.zip

Make sure to execute the following commands for the CNN based code
nltk.download('brown')
nltk.download('universal_tagset')

The results of running the CNN based code is already stored in this folder.
